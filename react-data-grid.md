#React Data Grid

A reusable, react component for showing a tabular dataset with pagination, filtering, sorting and infinite scroll

## Assignment
There are two parts to this assignment

  1) Create a react component that can represent tabular dataset and provide following capabilities

  - Configurable Columns, ie coulmns can be of any type (input/checkbox/text/date) etc
  - Pagination ie component should provide hooks to easily paginate and UI for pagination
  - Filtering ie component should provide some basic configurable filters and ability to create custom filters
  - Sorting, ability to do soritng on single/multiple columns
  - Abilitly to handle hundreds of thousands of rows without issue
  - Configurable Look and Feel as much as possible (Bonus Point)
  - Infinite scroll (Bonus Point)
  
2) Create an example project for this reusable data grid component. An example dataset is provided. 
Ideally the application will have two page
  - Upload a json/csv file with the dataset that is stored in the browser
  - Data grid representing this data and some filters designed for this data. The component 
  fetching the data should be written in a way that it should be easy to replace local dataset
  with an api.


### Directions
- You must use es6 + reactjs for this assignment. Recommend Use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
for bootstraping.
- Scope of the assignment is intentionally kept broad, so it's totally fine if it's not complete in the stipulated time. 
We would love to see the assignment anyway.
- keeping above point in mind, attempt the tasks in the order that they are mentioned.
- call us if you have any trouble understading anything
- most importantly, have fun building it :) :)
